text1 = "This movie was utter junk. There were absolutely 0 pythons. I don't see what the point was at all. Horrible movie, 0/10"
text2 = "I think this movie was extremely good, fabulous, superb, smart and beautiful, great."
text3 = 'beautiful good great amazing wonderful'
text4 = "If you are a preteen, the story may work for you. If you have any common sense, the bad dialogue and \
        blatant rip off of every sci-fi and fantasy movie cliche will drive you crazy. Special effects are decent, \
        and the story moves along at a decent pace. Momoa carries the film despite being surrounded by one \
        dimensional characters with digitally botoxed faces. I would never watch this movie again."
text5 = "I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. \
        The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. \
        Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to \
        be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices \
        (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed \
        environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. \
        It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. \
        I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic. Overral though, I wouldn't reccomend"
text6 = "I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that \
        its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development \
        is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific \
        moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, \
        but its more of an exception rather than the rule. But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least \
        4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie \
        (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end. Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points \
        characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black \
        manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face. WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by \
        trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one."
text7 = "Watched it!!! And have no words to describe the splendid performance of the cast and how beautifully wan visualised and presented \
        this..This is the true jewel so far in DC universeüëçüèª Won't Add any Spoilersüòã..as this is something you should witness"
